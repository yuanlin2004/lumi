## What is `lumi`?

`lumi` is an umbrella project that I use to teach myself the basics of deep learning and explore new ideas. It is just fun. 

> I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.

`lumi` builds many basis components from scratch using python, numpy, C++ and/or CUDA only. I deliberately stay away from any existing DL frameworks or inference engines, except for used in test verification and model transcoding. 

The project consists of two components 
1. a code and document [repo](https://github.com/yuanlin2004/lumi), some may find the change history useful too.
2. a [blog series](https://yuanlin2004.github.io/lumi-blog) which tell stories, lessons and learnings that cannot be easily conveyed by code and documents. 

This is the code repo.
